This document outlines how we run our meetups:

* Meetups:
** We organize meetups on a monthly basis that are open to the public. This allows us to bring folks together, in person in order to socialize, conduct business, mentor new members, and to recruit new folks into the hobby and hopefully our organization.

In order to respect our members time, meetups should not be more than an hour and a half long. A rough outline of a typical meetup agenda is as follows:

Ice Breakers, socializing, buying/selling/trading gear (10 - 20 minutes)
	 - This will foster a warm and inviting environment for new folks and create a positive atmosphere. It will also provide a consistent and safe place that folks can rely on to conduct transactions	 
	 
The bragging section ( 15 minutes)
	- Everyone loves to show a new piece of equipment or shine a light on a cool new project they are working on. As everyone takes their seats, folks have the opportunity to present to the entire group
	
Keynote Speaker (30 minutes)
	- This will consistent of a presentation to the group by a person of interest to the community, an educational lecture, or the (for example, school /community group) who is hosting the meeting to present to the meetup.
