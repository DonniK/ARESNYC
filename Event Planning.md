This document outlines the district's event planning process and should be considered not only a best practice but a requirement for all events under NYC ARES Banner.

Quick overview:
(Musts)
* Approval by DEC at least two (!) months in advance
* Members need to be informed at least 6 weeks in advance of the event - with a regular follow up several times before the event
* An online conference (via Zoom) one week before the event in order to set expectations
* All participants must be registered via [ARES Connect](https://arrl.volunteerhub.com/lp/nli/userregistrationwizard/usernamepassword)
