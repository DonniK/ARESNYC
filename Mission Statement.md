The goal of the New York City Amateur Radio Emergency Service is to __provide a meaningful volunteer experience__ for amateur radio operators in New York City.

We will do this by cultivating a community which fosters learning, teamwork, and the utilization of a hobby to contribute to public service.

By building and maintaining a community of amateur radio operators, we will be able to provide our partners with an effective team of radio operators who can execute world class communication via the amateur radio bands.

With the above as our guiding principles we achieve the goal of enriching the lives of our members and provide meaningful assistance to our community in times of need.
